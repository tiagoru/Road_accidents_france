# Steps in data processing and deadlines

## Step 0: Framing
Framing (Our first meeting): Deadline Friday, **26th May**

## Step 1: Data mining + DataViz’

**Deadline Friday, 16th June**

- Your first task will be to define the context and the scope of the project: I expect you to really take the time to understand the project and to learn as much as possible about the concepts it will introduce.

- You will then have to take in hand and discover your dataset and make an almost exhaustive analysis of it in order to highlight the structure, the difficulties and possible biases of the dataset.

You can use this template: [Template - Data audit report](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BZF56pzSsScHQZjJnM945iCcAKyxm2BqRsv7at-1bqY/edit?usp=sharing)
- I will also expect at least 5 graphical representations built from your dataset, visual and especially relevant. For each of them I will expect:
- A precise commentary, which analyzes the figure and provides a “business” opinion.
- A validation of the observation by data manipulation or a statistical test.

## Step 2: Pre-processing and feature engineering

**Deadline Friday, 14th of July**

- Following the observations made in the previous step, you will have to clean your dataset and perform the pre-processing steps.

- If necessary, you will have to transform and/or add features and enrich your dataset.

- The objective at the end of this step is to have a dataset ready to perform in-depth analysis and/or modeling using Machine (and Deep) Learning.

### Rendering 1: data exploration, data visualization and pre-processing report.
After rendering 1, if not already done, I will instantiate a GitHub repo for your group, which will have to respect the template provided and be sent to the jury with the final report.

## Step 3: Modeling
**Deadline Thursday, 13th October**

- Step 1: **Deadline Friday, 11th August**
    - Elaboration of the first modeling iterations with baseline models.
    - Analyze your first results, is your approach relevant? And your model?

- Step 2: **Deadline Friday, 15th September**
    - Use Machine Learning and statistical metrics to better understand the results of your model.
    - Optimization: Try to improve your model with optimization tools, you can try other more complex models and compare the results.

- Step 3:
    -Advanced modeling: Use bagging/boosting and Deep Learning techniques.
    -Interpretation: Use the interpretability tools to better understand the results of your models.
    -Scientific and business conclusions based on the success or failure of the modeling.

### Rendering 2: Modeling report.

## Step 5: Final report + codes on GitHub
**Deadline Thursday, 9th November**

- You will submit the final report: made up of the first two renderings, it concretizes your vision and your work on your project by integrating a conclusion and an opening.

- You also turn in your clean and commented code on GitHub, if time allows you will be able to refine your model and modeling pipeline during this step.

## Step 6: Streamlit + Defense
**Deadline Thursday, 18th December (to be confirmed)**

This last step will be used to develop an interactive web application through Streamlit that will serve as a showcase to share your project. Your application will have to be aesthetically pleasing, especially if:

- it contains several tabs, carefully coded
- does not re-train your model
- works without bugs.

The presentation will be as follows:
- 20 minutes of presentation
- 10 minutes of questions from the jury members

You have the possibility to make either :
- a Powerpoint presentation + Streamlit demo
- the entire presentation with your Streamlit application
