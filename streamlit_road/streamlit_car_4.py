    #### Goal
    The project relates to a to a **classification machine learning problem** in *traffic research*.
    
    It predicts the **severity of injuries** by traffic accidents on the basis of several 
    factors associated with the circumstances of the accident,
    and the involved persons and vehicles.

    #### Models
  
   - Decision Tree (Johanna)
   - Random Forest (Tiago)
   - XGBoost (Tobias)
   
    #### Target variable engineering
    
    The identified *target variable* is `grav`, which encodes the severity of the accidents in four classes:

    - 1: unscathed
    - 2: killed
    - 3: hospitalized
    - 4: light injured
        
    In principle, this is a **multi-class classification** problem.
    However, the performance of the multi-class classification modells were not sufficient. 
    
    Therefore the `grav` variable was engineered to a **binary** variable `severe` by merging classes:
    
    - 0: non-severe (classes 1 + 4)
    - 1: severe (classes 2 + 3)
    
    The multi-class classification problem is now reduced to a **binary classification** problem.
       
    #### Performance metrics and visualization
    - Accuracy
    - Precision
    - F1 score
    - Recall
    - Confusion matrix
    
    #### Feature importance and dimension reduction
    - SHAP modelling

            ### Decision Tree
            
            
            #### Introduction
            
            Decision Tree Classifier was chosen because of the high explainability and also due to the
            fact that the models are relatively simple to set up and to train.
            In addition to that, the performance of these models is also very good.
            In some cases, Decision Trees tend to overfit, but this problem can be eliminated with GridSearchCV technique.
            
             #### Hyperparameter Tuning with GridSearchCV 
             
             Since the performance of a model significantly depends on the value of hyperparameters it is necessary to determine the optimal values for a given model, in this case for the Decision Tree Model. And since there is no way to know in advance the best values for hyperparameters, it is also necessary to try all possible values to reach the best parameters. The solution for this is called GridSearchCV. It is the process of performing hyperparameter tuning in order to find the best parameters.
             
             The hyperparameters to be tuned are:
             - `criterion`
             - `max_depth` 
             - `min_samples_leaf`
             - `min_samples_split` 
             - `ccp_alpha`
             
             
             #### Optimal parameter for `max_depth`
             
             Since the result of the best parameter for max_depth is always the maximum of the predefined range, i.e. 10 for `max_depth`: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] or 8 for `max_depth`: [2, 4, 6, 8], the aim was to find out, at which point the accuracy doesn't improve further. Therefore the evaluation metric AUC (Area Under Curve) was chosen. AUC provides an aggregate measure of performance across all possible classification thresholds.""")

            #### Introduction

            Random Forest is a powerful ensemble learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks.
            It operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees during training and outputs the mode (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.

            #### Characteristics of Random Forest

            - High accuracy
            - Robust to overfitting
            - Handles imbalanced datasets well
            - Accommodates various data types
            - Provides built-in feature importance

            #### Model Hyperparameter Optimization

            The Random Forest model underwent hyperparameter optimization using techniques like grid search and random search. 
            The goal was to find the combination of hyperparameters that maximizes the model's performance.

            #### Tuning Space

            The Random Forest hyperparameter tuning involved exploring parameters such as the number of trees (`n_estimators`), the maximum depth of the trees (`max_depth`),
            and the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node (`min_samples_split`).

            #### Results and Interpretation

            The result of the optimized model were interpreted using the **classification report**, **accuracy score**,

            - The confusion matrix shows a **good rate** of **true positive** and **true negative** values.
            - The rates of **false positives** and **false negatives** reflect the overall **imbalance** of the dataset.

            - Reduction to a **binary classification** problem was **successfully** (accuracy of the the multi-class model was 0.51).
            - Further **predicate feature engineering** could improve the model (for instance by focussing on a curtain
            type of accident).
            
            #### Model interpretation using SHAP
            SHAP (**SH**apley **A**dditive ex**P**lanations) is an approach based on the game theory.
            It helps to interpret the outcomes of a given machine learning model by a fair allocation
            of the importance of a feature for the model outcome.
            
            The figure 2 shows the ranking of features largest influence on the modelling aggregated by SHAP values.

            Figure 2: Ranking of the most important features based on SHAP values
            
            Overall,
            - 9 features ranked high: `catv`, `obsm`, `catu`, `sexe`, `choc`, `manv`, `place`,
            - 2 variables are biased: `num_veh` and `obs` (meaning changed over time), and
            - 29 other features had only a low impact on the model.
            
            The variables encode:

            - `catv`: vehicle category
            - `obsm`: mobile object involved
            - `catu`: category of person (driver, passenger, pedestrian)
            - `sexe`: (binary) gender of the user
            - `obs`: fixed object involved (to be used with caution)
            - `choc`: chock point on the vehicle
            - `num_veh`: number of involved vehicle (to be used with caution)
            - `manv`: action prior to the accident (e.g. driving direction)
            - `place`: place of passenger in vehicle
            
            ##### Conclusion
            The highlighted features are majorly plausible, for example, a person in a van might be less affected by
            an accident that a pedestrian or cyclist.

    It is important to note that the XGBoost model had a performance of 83% of true positive predictions for the most severe class compared to the other two machine learning models.
